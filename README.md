# Crypto-Miner
Javascript Game

## Background
Crypto-Miner is a classic game of gathering money with the added twist of cryptocurrencies replacing gold.
You control a miner who sends out his claw to grab the precious cryptos, if you time it correctly. 
The objective of this game is to meet money goals for each level in order to progress.
An extra level of complexity is added by the volative nature of cryptocurrencies' worth; will you sell them as soon as the round is over, or will you wait it out in hopes of it's price going up?

## Functionality & MVP
With Crypto-Miner, users will be able to:
- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game
- [ ] Release the claw with DOWN key
   - [ ] The claw will move back and forth, in a semi-circle
- [ ] Sell Cryptocurrencies in-between rounds
- [ ] Mute the sound, using a button on the side
- [ ] Instructions panel on the side
- [ ] A production README


## Wireframes
This app will have a single screen with the game board, a title header, an instructions panel, buttons to Github, LinkedIn, and personal site, and a mute button.

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
How will you architect the game? Will it use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS or will you use a library like React? Will you use any other libraries or API's? Summarize the technical challenges you anticipate and how you plan to solve them.

## Timeline
This will be the road map for your application. You have about three days for this project. Refer to your MVP and group the features into three phases. Break down each phase into several sub-tasks to keep yourself organized.

You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).
